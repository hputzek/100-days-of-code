### What I've done today

> Generators are functions which can be exited and later re-entered. Their context (variable bindings) will be saved across re-entrances.

Generators in JavaScript -- especially when combined with Promises -- are a very powerful tool for asynchronous programming

I continued with my JS course; the chapter is about generator functions.
I did the introduction but do not really see how this would work with a "real world example".

Luckily the DIY programming lesson is coming up which hopefully clearifies that.

### What I'm planning to do next

I'll do the hands on and use generator functions and promises to do API calls.
