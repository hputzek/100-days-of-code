### What I've done today

Today I went on working at [a portfolio site](https://github.com/hputzek/portfolio-rocio "Repository in Github") I kickstarted some time ago.
I use [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) in conjunction with [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org).
With nuxt it is also possible to generate a static site at the end.
I'm going to try out [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ "Netlify: All-in-one platform for automating modern web projects") to host it there.

### What I'm planning to do next

There is a lot of work to be done concerning the portfolio :-)
