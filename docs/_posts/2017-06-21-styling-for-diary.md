Today I did learn some vanilla JS.

### What I've done today

* Implement a Fallback Icon for the "Link Dump": If no favicon is found, a standard icon is shown
* Added javascript to set a new gradient to header and buttons each time the page is loaded
* Did a lot of styling, also for responsive behaviour
* Fixed Link Icons: Link text does not flow around them when having multiple lines
* The current day is added automatically in the post headlines
	* could be improved by setting the startdate in ```config.yml```

### What I'm planning to do next

* Finish up the design of this diary
* Start with the next project: a portfolio page for a friend
