### What I've done today

I'm doing an udemy course at the moment which is called [Javascript ES6! A Complete Reference Guide to Javascript](https://www.udemy.com/javascript-es6-a-complete-reference-guide-to-javascript-es6/learn/v4/overview)

Topics today were

* Strings and Template Literals
* Block Bindings

Furthermore I did a [Codepen](https://codepen.io/hputzek/pen/KqxRmL "Codepen with the experiments I've done today") in which I tried out some dragging stuff.
Maybe I'll use that later on for a project.

### What I'm planning to do next

On Sunday I'll have a meeting for a 'real' project which will be portfolio site.
