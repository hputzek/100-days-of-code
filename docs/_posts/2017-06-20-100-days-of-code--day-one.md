My first project is to configure my diary.

What I've done today:

* Fork the original repo
* Add Jekyll and a template
* Configure the template
* Build a "link dump" functionality: 
	* Links and their description can be put in YAML FrontMatter
	* A link list is generated
	* The link list automatically tries to grab a favicon from the linked site and shows it if it finds one
	
What I'm planning to do next:
The diary still looks quite raw and ugly.
So I'll add some styling I think.
