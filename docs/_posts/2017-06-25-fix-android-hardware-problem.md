### What I've done today

One of the capacitive touch buttons in my phone is broken.
It triggers randomly all the time. This makes it hard to use the phone at all.
The phone is quite new but I ordered it from China and so it's to much fuzz to send it back.
So I disabled the buttons and activated the software emulated buttons instead.

Luckily the fingerprint sensor still works.

### What I'm planning to do next

Finally do some work for the [portfolio site](https://github.com/hputzek/portfolio-rocio "Portfolio Rocio on github"):
I have to tidy up and outsource some logic to distinct components.
