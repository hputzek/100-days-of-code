### What I've done today
![edx Course]({{ site.url }}/assets/js-promises-code.png "Promises example code")

I continued with my course about asynchronous programming in javascript.

I did the second assignment. This time it went better :-)

Furthermore I did some initial planning for a portfolio section on my personal site.

### What I'm planning to do next

Continue with the course and start with a portfolio section on my personal site.
