# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

### Main Commitment
*I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
June 20th, 2017.

In this repo I write my diary about it.
The code also serves as my playground to try out stuff, so it's not too clean ;-)

*You find the end product here:* http://putzek.com/100-days-of-code/
