# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

In this repo I write my diary about it.
The code also serves as my playground to try out stuff, so it's not too clean ;-)

**This repo can be forked by you if you want to use it as an easy way to keep track of the challenge**
Content can be added via markdown files. ([see here how that looks like](./docs/_posts))

Editing can be done directly in github if you want to.
Hosting via github pages.

### Main Commitment
*I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date (s)
* June 20th, 2017.
